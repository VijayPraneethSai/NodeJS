NPM is the standard package manager for NodeJS
NPM is a way to download and manage dependencies for both frontend and backend application using JavaScript.

basic npm commands

we need to use const _ require("<package-name>") in any file before using it.

npm init
- to create an app
- asks details like name version description git repo etc
- created the package.json file

npm install 
- to install dependencied
- creates node modules folder
npm install <package-name> [-g, --save-dev, --no-save, --save-optional, --no-optional]
- -g installs the package globally
- --save-dev installs in dev dependencies
- --save-optional saves the package in optional dependencies
- default this command installs locally in node modules
npm start
- in the package.json file we have the scripts object in which there is a start property 
   in that we can type nodemon <filename>.js
- now if we type npm start it will start executing the file which we can see in the terminal

npm install <package-name>@<version>
- for downloading older version of the package.

npm update

npm update <package-name>

npm run<task-name>

npm list
- to know all the packages installed in this project locally
- use -g to know globally installed packages

npm view <package-name> version
- to know the package version

npm view react versions
- gives all the avaiables version of react

npm uninstall <package-name>

npm help
