npm install express
- installs express
- this makes an entry in the dependencies object in package.json file
  as "express": ^4.18.1

  4 - The first digit is major version
  18 - the second digit is minor version
  1 - the third digit is patch version

  - if we have a ^ sybmol is means the minor or patch version can be changed
    so if we update the minor or patch version will only be updated never it will update the major version
  - sometimes we see ~ symbol (~ 4.18.1) this means only patch version is available
